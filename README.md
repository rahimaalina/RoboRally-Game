# RoboRally-Game
Java based board game
RoboRally is a multiple-player board game in which each player must program a robot to move in a factory which has a lot of dangerous obstacles. The robot, that moves in a discrete grid (or board), can only perform specific actions according to the random cards that are provided in each turn. The goal is to guide the robot to reach a certain checkpoint (actually there can be multiple checkpoints to be reached in a given order) while avoiding obstacles and impact with other robots. This project was done in a group of 5.
